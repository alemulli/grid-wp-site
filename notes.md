# Hook Lifecycle

Wordpress works off of a series of hooks that allow you to run your own code at specific points in the execution of the application. These hooks are divided into two categories: actions and filters.

You can think of these hooks as events that you can listen for and respond to. Actions are events that you can respond to by running your own code. Filters are events that you can respond to by modifying the data that is passed to them.

## Hook Manager Class
The hook manager class introduces a simple way to manage hooks. It utilizes a service container through PHP-DI to manage the hooks and their dependencies.
